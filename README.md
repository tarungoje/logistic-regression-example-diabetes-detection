# Diabetes Detection

Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.

As shown in the picture if you are trying to figure out the test will pass or fail; that is known as Logistic regression. Lets see some real world example
 <ul>
      <li>To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)</li>
      <li>Whether the tumour is malignant (1) or not (0)</li>
      <li>If you are diabetic  (1) or not (0)</li>
 </ul>




# Project:
To make the learning project easier and productive, we are going to learn Logistic Regression by an example of creating a logistic regression model to predict a user is Diabetic or not.
First we are going to collect the dataset and clean it. Then we will create a Logistic regression model with fitting the dataset.
