# Diabetes Detection

Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.

As shown in the picture if you are trying to figure out the test will pass or fail; that is known as Logistic regression. Lets see some real world example
 <ul>
      <li>To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0)</li>
      <li>Whether the tumour is malignant (1) or not (0)</li>
      <li>If you are diabetic  (1) or not (0)</li>
 </ul>




# Project:
To make the learning project easier and productive, we are going to learn Logistic Regression by an example of creating a logistic regression model to predict a user is Diabetic or not.
First we are going to collect the dataset and clean it. Then we will create a Logistic regression model with fitting the dataset. 

**FileName: diabetic_analysis_logistic_regression.ipynb**

Finally after a successive training itâ€™s our main goal to integrate our machine learning model with the GUIs. You can use tkinter for making a desktop application like we did in Linear Regression example, but here we are going to integrate it with a web framework i.e Flask, to create a website that will take the input parameters from the user and predict if they are Diabetic or not.

**Command to run the script: python flask_integration\app.py**
